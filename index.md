## The Alchemist Encodes ##

Hiya, we're The Alchemist Encodes, or TAE for short. Founded by Riven Skaye and
lateinautumn, we're but a humble fansubbing group that doesn't really do a large
volume of anime. Instead we focus on quality and improving what it is we put out there.

## General idea ##

We're mainly focused on being a group that puts out the best we releases we can make.
That means we care about the effort put into it, with the time taken being a bit
longer than what you'd expect from a seasonal group. We don't have release schedules
and we don't enforce project on members, we'd much rather see people work on things
on a volunteer basis where they pick a project they'll enjoy.

We will _never_ be a seasonal group. We much prefer taking our time and having no
set schedule so we can work on fansubs around our daily lives. That said, we also
don't want to endlessly stall and sometimes that means looking outside of our own
group to find someone to aid in finishing up a project.

And while we're on the topic of bringing in new people, we're welcoming one-off
project members just as much as we're willing to see if someone is a good fit
to stay on as staff. Though we do want a chance to get to know you since we need
to know if we can get along, at least on ~~a professional~~ an enthousiast level.
Getting along on a personal level is a definite bonus though.


## Open positions ##

While we're always willing to welcome all kinds of people for all kinds of roles,
there's always some roles that have a priority for bringing people in for. We'll
typically only list the roles here we're missing or that we haven't found a
permanent fit for.
Currently TAE is looking for:

- Song Translators (Song TLs)
- Karaoke Effect Designers (KFX)
- Translation Checkers (TLC)
- Typesetters (TS)
