## The Alchemist Encodes ##

Hiya, we're The Alchemist Encodes, or TAE for short. Founded by Riven Skaye and
lateinautumn, we're but a humble fansubbing group that doesn't focus on a large
volume of anime. Instead we focus on releasing the highest quality we can achieve.

## General idea ##

Our main focus is putting out high quality releases.
That means we spend a lot more time and energy into a release, causing us to
seemingly _stall_ or _starve_ our projects. Don't worry though, we'll release
them eventually.<br />
This also means that we **don't do seasonals**. The pace required for that
simply means having to make compromises we're not willing to make.
There's other groups that do those, and we'd be happy to provide recommendations
for seasonals over [in our discord server](https://discord.gg/weU8m754u9).

Last but not least, we're more than willing to help someone polish their skills,
or to take in more staff to run projects with us. For information about our
current projects, please take a look at [the recruitment page](/recruitment.html).
