## The Alchemist Encodes ##

Hiya, we're The Alchemist Encodes, or TAE for short. Founded by Riven Skaye and
lateinautumn, we're but a humble fansubbing group that doesn't focus on a large
volume of anime. Instead we focus on releasing the highest quality we can achieve.

## General idea ##

Our main focus is being a group that puts its all into making the best releases
we can. That means we put a great deal of passion, effort and time into our projects.
As a result we can take a bit longer than other groups and as such, we don't
have set release schedules.<br />An important sidenote is that we don't want projects
to indefinitely stall either, so we try and work on them when we can.

Another thing to note is that we will _never_ be a seasonal group. Due to preferring
to take our time so we can ensure a level of quality, and the lack of a set
release schedule to allow us that freedom, it just won't work.<br />
If you care about seasonals, grab a seasonal group's releases instead. If you'd
prefer to have us working on it, you're free to ask us to pick it up once BDs are out.

As for what shows we pick, that's a bit random. We pick up whatever we feel
is worth putting our time into. That means we'll generally be releasing things
that don't have any (watchable) releases out yet. If there's a release out there
that we feel is good enough to watch, then there's not much point in trying to
make something even better. Especially considering the amount of things that were
never released.

In the vein of true modern fansubbing, we're always willing to look at other people's
skills to try and bring them on board. Check out our [recruitment page](/recruitment.html) to see what
roles we're still looking to fill for current and upcoming projects.
Or maybe even for a more permanent position as part of the core team!<br />
Naturally we'd like a chance to see what you can do and some time to get to know you,
but so long as you have ~~a professional~~ an enthousiast level and get along,
we're more than willing to give you a shot.
